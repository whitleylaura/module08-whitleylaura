## Assignment

This module marked an introduction to molecular phylogenetics, a field that explores evolutionary relationships primarily through molecular data (i.e. DNA). For this assignment we used BEAST2 (Bouckaert et. al, 2019), a user-friendly program for phylogenetic analyses, alongside Tracer and FigTree (two complentary programs to BEAST2) to compare mitrochondrial DNA from 12 primate species, and produce a phylogentic tree of their probable relations.
